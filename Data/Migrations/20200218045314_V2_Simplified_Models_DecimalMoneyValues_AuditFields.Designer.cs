                            Description = @"AGROPRO started with 4 cofounders and the vision to develop technologies to transform agriculture worldwide. Headquartered in the Sonoran desert region in Mexico, the second largest and hottest desert in the world, and also a very important area for agricultural production that produces and exports thousands of tons of food.  We decided to face the biggest challenge of agriculture, that is to achieve 80% growth to meet the growing demand of the world population for food and products derived from this activity, as the UN states we can expect a growth of the world population to surpass the 9 billion inhabitants in 2050. It becomes necessary then to rethink the way to exploit agricultural fields, so that an efficient use of resources can be made and production levels increased. While agriculture provides food for millions of people, it is only through innovation that traditional practices can be improved, providing social and economic benefits, and even turning desert areas into important suppliers of food and income.
Our solution consists of using drones and special cameras to obtain aerial images of the crops, data then is processed to provide reports in an interactive online platform about the current state of crops. Doing this we can measure accurately and timely how the crops are doing and also save time and resources to farmers by having the right information to take actions if necessary.
With our online platform, the results of the aerial crop analyzes we do are visualized, containing relevant information for their decision making, and thus to optimize production by making more efficient use of inputs in areas specific, such as appropriate applications of agrochemicals, water and seeds.
We are transforming agriculture in benefit of consumers and producers around the world, though improving the optimization of inputs in specific areas, such as appropriate applications of water, agrochemicals and seeds.
Our value proposition is to provide the key information about the crops to the decision makers and support them to increase production by at least 5% and reduce costs from the use of agrochemicals, which account for the highest cost of up to 50% of the cost of production, by at least 10%.
We currently operate from Mexico in 10 countries in Latin America, the United States and Europe, with clients being producers, insurance companies, agrochemical manufacturers and financial institutions. And we look forward to keep growing and continue offering our services of crop analyses through our online platform, as well as to keep developing specific reports by type of crop as we keep learning the needs for different markets.",

Auubdire offers a smarter solution and at a price up to 9 times more accessible.

AuubDire develops the most intelligent Hearing Aid on the market, which simplifies the process of selecting and adapting it, through a single solution, adaptable and scalable to the needs of any patient, reducing up to 90 % the total cost compared to the current solutions in the market.
Our main innovation is that, unlike traditional hearing aids, the processing of audio signals is divided between the hearing aid and a mobile application in an intelligent device, since nowadays even a mid-range cell phone can perform 10 thousand times more operations per second than the most modern hearing aid in the market, with which we can make a finer adjustment of the audio signals, in addition to adding a series of unique benefits and all, at a lower price.

                            Description = @"We have almost 5 years solving challenges with technology. Baud was founded in Mexico City by Pedro Porras, a young mechatronics engineer and philosopher, maker, robotics teacher, university professor and FIRST mentor. Two years later Enrique Preza joined as a partner, he is an engineer too and founder of another entrepreneurship that he grew from zero for almost 6 years before partnering with Pedro and joining Baud´s team. His company develops monitoring systems for Data Centers. For example, their system generates the electricity bill for Sky at their Mexico City´s site. 

Our vision of empowering people with emergent technology began with projects of PCB design, IoT and firmware development and soon we began projects of communication experiences for brands, museums and businesses. During this time we made AR/VR apps, robotics, multimedia installations, web systems and other technologies to create experiences that brought a message to the user. In this process we learned a lot about developing technology products and experiences. 

On 2016 we partnered with Claudia Castellanos and Francisco Padilla to focus our company into the EdTech sector, pivoting into learning experiences with and about emergent technologies, using the know-how we have made with the other previous projects. Claudia describes herself as a “Disruptive pedagogist”, she is one of the pioneers in Mexico on the MakerEd movement and true advocate for STEAM (+H for Humanities). Francisco is also a pioneer on the robotics competitions in Mexico, he is director of two companies: one manufactures school furniture and builds learning spaces; the other distributes educational robots. That year was also the year in which we moved out from Pedro´s garage into a small office and hired our first full-time employees formally.

Our learning experiences model consists of an emergent technology at its core, with 4 elements surrounding it: educational content, gamification and storytelling, digital components (XR, Chatbots, apps, etc) and a physical side (kits and physical, hands-on  interfaces). Currently we are focused on Robotics and IoT for children but our expansion model aims to switch to, for example, AI for employees, Nanotechnology for University students, drones for teenagers, etc.

Since there was no hardware suitable for the learning experience we wanted to create with robotics and IoT, we developed Bucky, a low-cost educational robot with internet connectivity and visual programming (we developed our own programming language too, Flowde) that can be implemented on the reality of the education in Mexico (low budgets, non English speakers, non expert teachers, no infrastructure, etc), actually, you can build cardboard robots with it. Bucky was founded with a Government grant from CONACyT, our profits of the ad-hoc projects and with a crowdfunding campaign that we successfully made on Kickstarter. We are currently starting the first deliveries of the kickstarter orders and already signed a distribution contract with one of the most important distributors in LA for STEM competitions. 

More recently, Fernando Valenzuela, the 5th partner joined us to bring his experience of decades into the EdTech business to help us grow and find funding. He is a former McGraw Hill and HP director, board member of more than 8 education companies and endeavor mentor. This month we signed our first private investment through a convertible note and received a notification from INADEM (the entrepreneurship side of the Economy Secretariat) granting us another funding deal. Nevertheless, we are still seeking to gather the total amount that we need as investment to complete the educational ecosystem of Bucky to bring a very competitive product to the market.

We are already operating in 11 countries: Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Brazil, etc. We plan to consolidate our presence and our sales in these countries in the coming months. We are also currently in talks with operators in Spain and Mexico to implement our Programmatic TV solution with them.

We will help them monetize their content through the use of our programmatic ad buying platform.
We went from 2 to 35 people in less than 2 years, with a 259% annual revenue growth. We launched more than 700 campaigns for the biggest brands with most of the largest media agencies in Latam.
Most of our current revenues come from advertisers, as we manage directly their marketing campaign and charge a fee to do so.
With the projects under way with big operators and broadcasters in Latam and Spain, we plan to experience another 300% growth in revenue in 2018.",

OUR HISTORY

Mexico is one of the countries that most attends concerts in Latin America. We personally attended many concerts, we realized the great culture that exists in Mexico, that made us enter to investigate the market, we discovered that a concert on average generates 300% of gain (there are events such as festivals live Latino, lollapalluza, tomorroland that generate more than 10X), we started to study countries with concert culture in other countries and then we discovered the opportunity.

When developing our business model, we discovered that more industries require investment to generate quality events, that's when we started to develop the current model.

We launched our market test with a very simple landing page (you can still see it at www.inderspace.com) and we started selling, we discovered that many people are excited to invest in Inder Space projects. Then we decided to develop the complete platform and how we wanted it.

Leanflow is the first logistics platform for Manufacturers, 3PLs and Carriers that give them the reliability that only an Automated Supply Chain can provide. We are currently training LUX – our Artificial Intelligence engine that can automate, optimize and prevent anomalies in the supply chain. We feed LUX with data from our own IoT devices to get precise and continuous information that it’s crucial for making a more accurate AI engine. 

Our comprehensive platform includes all the operational (scheduling, tracking, reporting, notification and alerts), commercial (smart contracts, RFQ and communication and collaboration tools) and financial (billing, collection, aging reports, P&L reports) activities related to the logistics operations of a company.

Market size
According a study made by Transparency Market Research (TMR), logistics global market currently worth is US $8.1 tn and it is expected to grow to $15.5 tn by 2024. The report also said that the investment in technological innovation is one of the major drivers in the market due to the high level of competition in a highly fragmented market. 

Technical Roadmap
We’ve been developing the platform for the past two years. It’s currently in Beta version with plans to release the final version in 2019.  Our platform is constantly expanding: the roadmap is to add platform functionality for Distribution Centres, Warehouses and Customs Agents by 2020. 

Commercial Expansion
Leanflow is technically ready to be commercialized globally and currently supports 4 languages English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. We commercialize in Mexico only, but we have expansion plans for next year to: US, Canada and Brazil using online commercialization along with partnerships with local distributors.

Founded as non-profit organization in 2011, our team with members of different gender and nationalities continuously is working on realizing our vision of contributing to the sustainable development of Mexico by developing internationally recognized technological solutions. 
Since 2014, we have been developing intelligent power conversion devices that help integrating renewable energy sources in the electricity grid. Initially working on an intelligent solid state transformers, we shifted our focus on the development on an advanced residential solar inverter in 2017. A large part of the technology and knowledge development of the former project is implemented in this inverter, which will be our first commercial product. Currently, we have reached a prototype with TRL6, which we plan to scale to TRL7 in 2019 and implement the first beta products in a pilot plant. The implementation in pilot installations in 2019 will help us to gather real world experience and refine the product. In 2020, we will certify the inverter, before launching it to the market and entering into mass production. To resume, we are currently transforming from a technical investigation laboratory into an innovative tech startup, with the objective of introducing an innovative product to the local and international market in 2020.

Jorge Guzman entrusted us with the need for Emovere to bring to the market a new product based on its highly disruptive technology, which he named the Human Type Cognitive Process (HTCP: Human Type Cognitive Process). We offered to be that medium and put on the table the \"Virtual Assistant for Smartphone\" since it meets low costs of development, production and marketing; At the same time, it attacks a growing need for support for daily activities and covers a global market. Emovere liked it because he will be able to make known two things that HTCP achieves and that Artificial Intelligence has not been able (and will not) be able to do: that machines make decisions based on common sense and the natural language process, everything like Human does it. Given this, we obtained an \"Exclusivity Contract\" for the use of HTCP for our product and all the support that Emovere can offer us, such as flexibility in investments and payments, opportunities that will only be present for this occasion. Actual status MPcognitivos is already registered as a company before the public registry of the property and before the property with registration MPC170322J78.

Our clients are individuals or legal entities (businesses) that want to sell their products or services to customers whose payment method is a credit or debit card. Our payment solutions cover the multi-channel approach which includes our mobile POS (mPOS)terminal for our associated merchants to sell in their phisical store using our mobile application available in Android and iOS under the name “MexPago” or using our flexible APIs connected to their online stores, our associated merchants often use both. In addition to our means of payment, we offer to our associated merchants our branded ""MexPago Card"" (a credit card that operates as a debit and therefore as a savings account) as an instrument to use the money received in their MexPago virtual account where their sales are deposited.

Additionally, we have a mobile application (""MexPago Pay"") that is designed for underbanked or unbanked consumers. When these consumers sign up in our platform, a digital virtual bank-like account (e-wallet) is created for them at no cost. Very often these Consumers are born in our system with our branded MexPago Card where they receive funds for part-time jobs to then use these funds to purchase products and services from our associated merchants in addition to bill payments and top ups. Most recently we added the largest MNO in Mexico as our strategic partner and their services as bundles are offered in our mobile application MexPago Pay. MexPago also offers for the e-wallet to be topped up on traditional channels such as cash or wire transfer deposits through traditional channels which we are working every day to increase. Our revenues come from transactional fees from our Acquirer business as well as that from our branded MexPago Card.

Personally, I lived this situation, first my father used to lend money to friends and neighbors, because they didn’t have the chance to get a credit from the bank. And second as an expat, living in different countries and without a financial history in each country, was very difficult for me to rent an apartment, request a credit card or even to have a cellular plan or get a cable TV service.

The lack of evaluations and scoring tools, forbid the access to financial services for two large market segments:
1.	people who doesn’t have a financial history at all, also called “NO-HITS”
2.	people who are already banked, but with not enough financial information are rejected, because banks doesn’t know how to measure them. Also called “THIN-FILES”

moyoAI is a solution that measure “the intention to repay”, through three elements:
a psychometric test + machine learning + artificial intelligence.

We are based in Mexico City. My partner and co-founder is from India. We decided to validate the solution and the business model in India first, because of: (1) large and diverse population, (2) country’s experience in microcredit (3) contacts with banks and non-bank financial institutions.

In the last two years, we evaluated +300,000 credit transactions, and we helped to authorized +240,000 loans.

We officially launch the company last year, under the name of moyoAI, and we started the expansion to Latin America. We plan to expand to UK, Europe and Africa in the near future.

The idea & company graduated from the Founder Institute (http://fi.co), program that prepared the founder with the necessary tools to elaborate the PITCH, product development, market analysis, customer reach, etc.  Originally created as a mobile app that eases the process to create contracts for freelancers, it then transformed to an integral solution (SaaS) for companies that desired a seamless legal process to deliver & execute their contracts. 

Before graduation, TRATO received and investment of US$220,000 DLLS to create the product. After visiting several potential customers, the company released a version on January 2017. From then, it was accepted on Batch 7 of 500 Startups LATAM and received another investment from AVALANCHA VENTURES. The product has been received with great enthusiasm from legal & compliance departments of banks and big companies (BBVA Bancomer, Rotoplas, LIPU, SMX Financial, INVEX, Cabify, among others). 

With only 9 collaborators, mainly devs, tech-lawyers, sales, customer success & marketing, the company has managed to avoid further investment and has been growing on-boarding at least 2 new clients per month. On February 2018, the company was selected to a program that helps you learn about expansion globally in New York and changes where made to translate the software to English and adapt contracts to their jurisdiction. We found great areas of opportunity to expand to  a global market and several relevant investors expressed their interest  to invest for this purpose. However the company decided to spend 2018 on consolidating in the Latin American Market but we are prepared to grow globally starting 2019.  US or UK?  That is the question. ",

We are currently working with Audi AG developing VR trainings. In several benchmarks that we have performed, our methods and processes are based in hard data and scientific evidence and the quality of out developments is of global class. We have been doing research in collaboration with major universities that proves that our VR experiences are effective. We have also intellectual property on some of the technology we have created.

Our main goal is to keep our Mexican operations but to establish Yeltic as a global brand and operate overseas. We have had great resonance and interest from European manufacturing companies that adopt our services, so we believe that a European Headquarter would be an efficient way to achieve this goal and serve an expanding market.",
